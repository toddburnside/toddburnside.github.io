It's pretty sparse here at the moment...

##Presentations

### Higher Kinded Types? Why Should I Care?
At the [PDXScala Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PDXScala/) on 17 October, 2017. Slides are available 
[here](presentations/higher-kinded-types/slides.html). The presentation was created with [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark). Hitting '__p__' while in the slides will show the presentation notes, and '__?__' will provide addtional help.
To try to make them useful, I added more notes than I needed for the talk, but they're still just slides. Most of the source 
code in the presentation was compiled with [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) to make sure it was correct. Many thanks to
[Rob Norris](https://github.com/tpolecat) for both tut and providing an example of how to use tut with remarkjs.

### Older Talks
I also gave a couple of earlier talks at PDXScala which I turned into blog posts.
1. [Ad-Hoc Polymorphism and Typeclasses in Scala](http://amonkeymindatplay.blogspot.com/2015/10/ad-hoc-polymorphism-and-typeclasses-in.html) in October 2015
2. [Curried Functions in Scala](http://amonkeymindatplay.blogspot.com/2016/04/curried-functions-in-scala.html) in April 2016
